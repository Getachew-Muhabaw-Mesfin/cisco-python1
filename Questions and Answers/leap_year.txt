Your task is to write and test 
a function which takes one argument (a year) and 
returns True if the year is a leap year, or False otherwise.

The seed of the function is already sown in the skeleton code in the editor.

Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.

The code uses two lists ‒ one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results. The code will tell you if any of your results are invalid.

LAB   How many days: writing and using your own functions
Your task is to write and test a function which takes two arguments (a year and a month) and returns the number of days for the given year-month pair (while only February is sensitive to the year value, your function should be universal).

The initial part of the function is ready. Now, convince the function to return None if its arguments don't make sense.

Of course, you can (and should) use the previously written and tested function (LAB 4.3.1.6). It may be very helpful. We encourage you to use a list filled with the months' lengths. You can create it inside the function ‒ this trick will significantly shorten the code.

We've prepared a testing code. Expand it to include more test cases.
